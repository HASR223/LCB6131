				<h2>Explore The World  <br>Of Badminton</h2>
				<p>The beginnings of badminton can be traced to the mid-1800s,<br> 
				where it was created by British military officers stationed in <br>
				British India.In India badminton was first known as “poona”</p>

				<h2>What Is Badminton?</h2>
				<p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court.</p>
